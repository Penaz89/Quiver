An advanced SSH-accessible Terminal User Interface (TUI) application built with [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish), [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), and [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). Originally created to fulfill a **personal need** for a centralized self-hosted dashboard, it is specifically designed to be **deployed via Docker Compose** and accessed remotely using **[NeXterm](https://nexterm.dev/)** (or any SSH client) for a secure, terminal-based management experience on any home server.

## Features

- **Multi-user Authentication**: Secure login system with bcrypt encryption. Each user's data is isolated in their own personal directory. Includes account creation and secure logout functionalities.
- **Admin Control Panel**: A special `admin` user is generated automatically on the first run. The admin has access to an exclusive menu to list, add, edit, and securely delete users.
- **Dynamic Home Dashboard**: A fully responsive landing page summarizing your financial totals, upcoming deadlines (drawn from Tasks, Vehicles, and Insurances), your latest Journal notes, and your most recently added Tasks.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Integrated chat interface allowing users within the same Quiver instance to communicate in real-time, featuring a clean, responsive layout.
- **GTD Task Management**: A Kanban-style "Getting Things Done" workflow. Track tasks across columns (`TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`) with priority markers, projects, and deadlines.
- **Habit Tracker**: Track daily habits in a "Don't Break The Chain" style, visualizing progress with a GitHub-style ASCII heatmap.
- **Journal**: A personal plain-text daily journal featuring date-based navigation and automated Markdown export capabilities.
- **Financial & Vehicle Tracking**: Advanced modules for calculating personal finances (rent/mortgage, holidays, subscriptions) to give you accurate monthly and annual burn rates. Includes comprehensive vehicle management for tracking maintenance ("Tagliando"), road tax, and insurance deadlines.
- **Live Weather**: Integrated weather widget utilizing `wttr.in`.
- **Localization (i18n)**: Full support for both English and Italian languages, changeable seamlessly from the Settings menu.
- **Modern ASCII Branding**: Cohesive and readable visual identity using "Slant" ASCII fonts, optimized for constrained terminal layouts.
- **Stateless & Portable**: Fully Dockerized architecture. Destroy and recreate the container at will; just mount a volume to persist user data, settings, and SSH host keys.

```

The container is **fully stateless**. All application data is serialized in JSON files and stored alongside SSH host keys on a mounted Docker volume at `/data`.

## Deployment

Quiver is built with cross-platform deployment in mind and is completely agnostic to the underlying host, making it perfect for Raspberry Pi or NAS setups. 

### 1. Portainer / Docker Compose (Recommended)

Quiver is heavily optimized to be deployed as a Portainer Stack.

```yaml
services:
  quiver:
    image: quiver:latest
    build: .
    container_name: quiver_app
    ports:
      - "2222:2222"
    volumes:
      - quiver_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  quiver_data:
```
**In Portainer:**
1. Navigate to **Stacks** -> **Add stack**.
2. Paste the `docker-compose.yml` above.
3. Click **Deploy the stack**.
4. Connect via terminal: `ssh localhost -p 2222` (replace localhost with your server's IP).

### 2. Docker CLI

If you prefer the command line:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t quiver .

# Run the container with a persistent named volume
docker run -d \
  --name quiver \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  -v quiver_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  quiver
```

### 3. Local Development (No Docker)

To compile and run the application directly on your host machine:

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the SSH server locally
QUIVER_DATA_DIR=./data go run .

# In another terminal window, connect via SSH
ssh localhost -p 2222
```

## Configuration

The application requires minimal configuration, handled entirely via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `QUIVER_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | IP address the SSH server listens on. |
| `QUIVER_PORT` | `2222` | Port the SSH server listens on. |
| `QUIVER_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Path to the persistent storage directory. |

## Volume & Persistence

The mapped `/data` volume will generate the following structure automatically:
- `host_key_ed25519`: The secure SSH host key. Persisting this prevents SSH clients from throwing warnings if you recreate the container.
- `admin_auth.json`: Secure bcrypt credentials for the default admin user.
- `{username}/`: Dedicated folders containing all JSON-based data stores (habits, journal, tasks, finances, etc.) for that specific user.

### Backing Up Data

```bash
docker run --rm -v quiver_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/quiver-backup.tar.gz -C /data .
```

### Restoring Data

```bash
docker run --rm -v quiver_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/quiver-backup.tar.gz -C /data
```

## Remote Access & SSH Clients

### NeXterm (Recommended)
For the best experience, especially when accessing Quiver remotely, we recommend using **[NeXterm](https://nexterm.dev/)**. It provides a robust, web-based terminal interface that handles SSH connections beautifully, making it easy to access your dashboard from any browser.

### Standard SSH Client Tips
During testing and development, you might tear down and rebuild the container frequently without persisting the host keys. To prevent `known_hosts` strict checking issues, append this to your `~/.ssh/config`:

```text
Host localhost
    Port 2222
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    LogLevel ERROR
```
